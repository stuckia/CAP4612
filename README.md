# **Assignment 2**
### *House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning*
Objective: Create a machine-learning model that predicts house prices using
multiple features. Students will try several regression algorithms such as linear, ridge, and
lasso regression. Then evaluate their performance and adjust the models for accurate predictions.

# **Assignment 3**
### *Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Machine Learning*
Objective: Create a machine-learning model that classifies digits from 0 to 9
using multiple features. You will try several classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision
tree, etc. Then evaluate their performance of 10 classes (0 to 9) and show accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-scores.
